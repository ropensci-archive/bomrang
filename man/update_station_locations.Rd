\title{Update bomrang Internal Databases with Latest BOM Station Metadata}
\usage{
update_station_locations()
}
\value{
Updated internal databases of BOM station locations and JSON URLs
}
\description{
Download the latest station locations and metadata and update bomrang's
internal databases that support the use of \code{\link{get_current_weather}}
\code{\link{get_ag_bulletin}} and \code{\link{get_historical}}.  There is no
need to use this unless you know that a station exists in BOM's database
that is not available in the databases distributed with \pkg{bomrang}. In
fact, for reproducibility purposes, users are discouraged from using this
function.
}
\details{
If \pkg{ASGS.foyer} is installed locally, this function will automatically
check and correct any invalid state values for stations located in Australia.
If \pkg{ASGS.foyer} is not installed, the function will update the internal
database without validating the state values for stations by reported lon/lat
location.
